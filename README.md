# Ignis Et Terra
### A 2D magic casting, rock blasting and pun masking survival based game.

## Premise
A survival game where magic is able to be used for many things that would normally be done with tools (Pickaxe, Axe, Shovel) like breaking boulders and cutting down trees. There will be enemies to fight and animals to care for, There will be day and night cycles and even seasons to worry about. A select list of some of my favourite games are:

- Don't Starve
- Oxygen Not Included
- Minecraft
- Magicka
- Noita
- Stardew Valley
- No Time at Portia
- Many, many more

So hopefully that gives you an idea of the direction I want to take this game. Much inspiration has come from these games and I have a somewhat wildly creative imagination that helps me to fill in the blanks. I don't claim that this game will be released or even playable for.. Honestly quite a long time as my creativity while useful for envisaging an incredible game can be a great hinderance when trying to assemble said game concept into a real product.

I wish you all luck in all your own great endeavours and thank you for having a look at mine.

## State of the Game

TLDR; Non-existant, Basic structure and foundations are being built for the game to one day reign supreme over and direct as it wills.
